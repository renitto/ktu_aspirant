2. Examination 
 
a. At the end of the semester, end semester examination will be conducted in all lecture based courses offered in the semester and will normally be of three hours duration, unless otherwise specified. Supplementary examinations shall be conducted before the commencement of the next semester, for students who are eligible and have registered for them. 

b.  Students, who have completed a course but could not write the end semester examination for valid reasons like illness or personal exigencies, are allowed to write the supplementary examination or the end semester examination at the next opportunity and earn the credits without having to register for the course again provided they meet other eligibility criteria. 

c. The main eligibility criteria for the end semester examination are attendance in the course, internal marks and no pending disciplinary action. The minimum attendance for appearing for the end semester examination is 75% in each course. Further, the internal evaluation marks in the course should be 45% or above. Students who do not meet these eligibility criteria are awarded an FE grade and have to register for the course again. 

d. Students who could not write the end semester examination due to health reasons or other exigencies can register for the supplementary examination, with the approval of the principal provided they have 45% or above marks in the internal evaluations for the course.  Candidates who received F grade can also write the supplementary examination. Grades awarded in the supplementary examination will be taken as the end semester grades in these courses.
