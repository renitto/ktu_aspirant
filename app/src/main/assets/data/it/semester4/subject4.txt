Database Users, Three Schema architecture of DBMS. Database architectures and classification. (Reading:
ElmasriNavathe, Ch. 1 and 2. Additional Reading: Silbershatz, Korth, Ch. 1) 

Entity-Relationship Model:

---FIRST INTERNAL EXAM---


MODULE II

Relational Model: 

Structure of relational Databases, Integrity Constraints, synthesizing ER diagram to relational schema (Reading: ElmasriNavathe, Ch. 3 and
8.1, Additional Reading: Silbershatz, Korth, Ch. 2.1- 2.4) 

Database Languages: Concept of DDL and DML relational algebra (Reading: Silbershatz, Korth, Ch 2.5-2.6 and 6.1-6.2, ElmasriNavathe, Ch. 6.1-6.5)


MODULE III

Structured Query Language (SQL): 

Basic SQL Structure, examples, Set operations, Aggregate Functions, nested sub-queries (Reading: ElmasriNavathe, Ch. 4 and 5.1) Views, assertions and triggers (Reading: ElmasriNavathe, Ch. 5.2-5.3, Silbershatz, Korth Ch. 5.3). Functions, Procedures and HLL interfaces (Reading: Silbershatz, Korth Ch. 5.1-5.2).


MODULE IV

Relational Database Design: 

Different anomalies in designing a database, normalization, functional dependency (FD), Armstrong's Axioms, closures, Equivalence of FDs, minimal Cover (proofs not required). Normalization using functional dependencies, INF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF, lossless and dependency preserving decompositions (Reading: Elmasri and Navathe, Ch. 14.1-14.5, 15.1-15.2. Additional Reading: Silbershatz, Korth Ch. 8.1-8.5).


---SECOND INTERNAL EXAM---


MODULE V

Physical Data Organization: 

index structures, primary, secondary and clustering indices, Single level and Multi-level indexing, B-Trees and B+-Trees (basic structure only, algorithms not needed), Indexing on multiple keys (Reading Elmasri and Navathe, Ch. 17.1- 17.4) 

Query Optimization: 

algorithms for relational algebra operations, heuristics-based query optimization, Cost-based query optimization (Reading Elmasri and
Navathe, Ch. 18.1-18.3, 18.6 -18.8)


MODULE VI

Transaction Processing Concepts: overview of concurrency control and recovery acid properties, serial and concurrent schedules, conflict serializability.
