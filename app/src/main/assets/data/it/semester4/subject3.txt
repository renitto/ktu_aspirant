MODULE I

Why Do We Need Object-Oriented Programming? - Procedural Languages - The Object-Oriented Approach - Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages - Objects - Classes - Inheritance - Reusability - Creating New Data Types - Polymorphism and Overloading - C++ and C

Objects and Classes - A Simple Class - Classes and Objects - Defining the Class - Using the Class - Calling Member Functions - C++ Objects as Physical Objects - C++ Objects as Data Types - Constructors - Destructors - Objects as Function Arguments - Overloaded Constructors - Member
Functions Defined Outside the Class - Objects as Arguments - The Default Copy Constructor - Static Class Data - const and Classes


MODULE II

Arrays and Strings - Array Fundamentals - Arrays as Class Member Data - Arrays of Objects - The Standard C++ string Class

Operator Overloading - Overloading Unary Operators - Overloading Binary Operators - Data Conversion


---FIRST INTERNAL EXAMINATION---


MODULE III

Inheritance - Derived Class and Base Class - Derived Class Constructors - Overriding Member Functions - Which Function Is Used?

Class Hierarchies - Public and Private Inheritance - Levels of Inheritance - Multiple Inheritance


MODULE IV
